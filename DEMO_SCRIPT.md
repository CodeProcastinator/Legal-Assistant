"Hi! I'm presenting the GenAI Legal Assistant - an AI-powered tool that helps Indian SMEs analyze contracts quickly and safely.

"Let me show you the app. This is our Streamlit-based interface.

First, you can see my API key is already configured automatically via environment variables, so it's secure.

Now, let me upload a sample vendor contract. You can see we support PDF, Word, and text files.

[Upload vendor_contract_sample.txt]

The document is parsed - 850 words. Let me click 'Analyze Contract'."

## SECTION 3: Risk Analysis (1.5 minutes)

**[Show: Analysis tab]**

"Here are the results. The Risk Score is 78 out of 100 - that's HIGH risk!

Let's look at what was found:

1. **Unlimited Liability** - The contract says 'liable for all damages whatsoever'. This could bankrupt a small business!

2. **One-sided Termination** - The company can terminate anytime, but the vendor needs 90 days notice. Very unfair.

3. **Payment Terms** - 7-day payment and advances required - bad for cash flow.

4. **Foreign Jurisdiction** - Disputes go to Singapore courts - expensive for an Indian SME!

Each finding has a clear recommendation. For example, 'Negotiate a liability cap of 1-2x contract value.'"

## SECTION 4: AI Insights (1 minute)

**[Show: Insights tab]**

"The Insights tab uses Google Gemini AI for deeper analysis.

We extracted key dates - the contract runs Jan 2024 to Jan 2026.

Financial terms - Rs. 5,00,000 advance payment mentioned.

The AI provides a plain-language summary and specific negotiation tips. You can even ask questions about the contract!"
